# Notepad

A simple Notepad proof-of-concept-app inspired by the design work of Michael West - https://michaelwest.design/

This app still is in a very early stage, as it was meant as an XAML proof-of-concept for Notepad with Fluent Design. Feel free to check it out!

Not feeling like building the project yourself? A build and signed version is available to download from the Microsoft Store for free! https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N7LRQ8P8PD5
